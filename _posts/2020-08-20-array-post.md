## Find most frequent item of an array with Javascript

When I interviewed a while ago, I was asked the following quiz that needs to find out the most frequent item of an array. It's been years that I interview to get this type of question so I was freak out. But, the quiz was simple enough ðŸ˜….

I was thinking too much to solve the quiz haha ... finally I got the result.

If I did with python then it may easier to solve.

Return result would be

```
{'apple': 2, 'banana': 1, 'grape': 1, 'orange': 1}
```

that's enough.
